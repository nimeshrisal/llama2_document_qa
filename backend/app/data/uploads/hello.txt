1.1. Background
Unemployment disturbs economic growth and it is a significant economic problem globally (Yadav, 2024). Unemployment rate refers to the percentage of those individuals who are willing to work and are able to work but cannot find employment opportunities. (Orji et al., 2015). A lot of young individuals in the world suffer from getting their preferred jobs. The economic issue, unemployment, is serious in many member states of the International Labor Organization (ILO) (O'Higgins, 2001). Unemployment has been a persistent challenge in the developed countries after the 2009 financial crisis. Over 41 million people were unemployed in 2014 with an average unemployment rate of around 8.3% in the member countries of the European Union. Some countries like Germany, the UK and the US have managed unemployment by reducing it through labor market reforms while other economies with rigid labor laws and slow economic growth use to struggle with unemployment problems (Bhattarai, 2016). Factors such as economic recessions, technological changes that replace jobs and mismatches between workers’ skills and job requirements can cause unemployment. In addition, the structural issues such as high minimum wages or strict hiring and firing of the organization can make it hard for people to find preferred jobs. The governments of each country have a crucial role to tackle unemployment issues through policies like job training programs, stimulus spendings, and labor market reforms, however the effectiveness of these measures varies depending on the countries’ economic situation and policies (Bhattarai, 2016).
Inflation is a continuous rise in the general price level across the country over time.  In other words, it is a result of substantial and persistent increase in the volume of money and borrowing in comparison to the number of goods and services available. This causes the rise in the price level. Inflation poses a challenge to the economy by eroding real income, reducing consumer purchasing power, and creating uncertainty that disrupts financial planning and investment decisions (Orji et al., 2015).  Moderate inflation is normal in growing economies, while high or unpredictable inflation can harm consumers and businesses, creating a difficulty in savings. Many countries across the world have adopted inflation-targeting policies over the past few decades in order to keep inflation low and stable (Bhattarai, 2016). Inflation is driven by various factors such as increased demand for goods, higher wages or oil prices, printing more money and so on in an economy. In the 1970s, many countries faced “stagflation,” where high inflation combined with high unemployment caused economic turmoil. In today’s world, inflation rates in advanced economies are generally lower and more stable compared to developing or emerging economies. However, there are constant challenges that remain because of supply chain disruptions or geopolitical events that cause sudden price spikes in the world (Bhattarai, 2016). Low inflation is desirable; therefore, policymakers must also consider its trade-offs with unemployment. In the past, there has been a lot of debate in the context of the Phillips Curve relationship, that lower unemployment might lead to higher inflation and vice versa. However, this relationship has weakened in recent years, with many countries experiencing low inflation even when unemployment is lower. 
The study is intended to examine the relationship between inflation and unemployment by testing the Phillips Curve Hypothesis and its existence in the context of Nepal. The theory states that there is an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment (PHILLIP, 1958). The term inflation and unemployment remain critical challenges in every economy. The policymakers generally aim to keep both inflation and unemployment at minimal levels. Many economists suggest that maintaining inflation in the single digits and unemployment around five percent could promote economic stability in an economy, other things remaining the same. Economic stability is essential for long-term growth, planning and development of an economy (Orji et al., 2015).
The connection between inflation and unemployment is a key part of understanding how an economy works. Nepal is a country with its own set of social and economic challenges and understanding how these two factors are connected helps us see how well economic policies are working and what problems the country faces (Yadav, 2024).
1.2 Problem Statement
Unemployment and inflation are the most critical macroeconomic indicators and the issues that influence a country's economic stability and policy decisions (Kartika & Kurniasih, 2020; Alisa, 2015). In Nepal, unemployment is a major concern because there is a high rate of youth unemployment, high levels of informal unemployment, limited industrial diversification and a significant mismatch between the skills imparted by the education systems and the skills demanded by the employer firms (Sharma & Poudel, 2023). Due to this severe mismatch between the skills of the young workforce and the demands of the labor market, many educated youths either remain underemployed in informal sectors or migrate abroad in search of work, leading to a brain drain that further weakens domestic economic potential (Yadav, 2024). The major reason for the unemployment problem in Nepal is its paradoxical relationship with remittances because it contributes nearly 25-30% of GDP (Yadav, 2024). The remittances reduce immediate poverty and stabilize household incomes but they create a dependency syndrome where the economy fails to generate productive jobs domestically (Yadav, 2024). Many working-age Nepalese migrate to gulf countries for job opportunities, leaving behind the labor shortages in key sectors like agriculture and construction. This reliance on foreign employment creates the true extent of unemployment, as those working abroad are not counted in domestic unemployment statistics (Yadav, 2024). Also, Yadav, (2024) highlights that the low wage system discourages youth to sustain in Nepal, causing brain drain. 
Inflation, on the other hand, in Nepal is deeply rooted in its economic structure and external dependencies (Nepal Rastra Bank, 2024). As per Nepal Rastra Bank reports on inflation, it is a critical macroeconomic indicator that reflects the overall health of the economy. Historically, Nepal has experienced significant fluctuations in inflation, influenced by factors such as monetary policy, supply-side constraints, and external shocks, particularly from India, its primary trading economy. One of the major reasons for Inflation is the fixed exchange rate with India (Joshi, 2021). The country's inflation trends have evolved over decades, with periods of high volatility, such as the early 1990s, when economic liberalization and currency devaluation led to spikes in prices. More recently, inflation has been driven by global commodity price fluctuations, domestic agricultural output, and transportation costs, with food and beverage prices often being the most volatile. The report emphasizes that inflation in Nepal is closely tied to Indian inflation due to the open border, fixed exchange rate, and heavy reliance on imports, which amplify the transmission of price changes from India to Nepal (Nepal Rastra Bank, 2024).
The indicative inflation target rate set by monetary policy for Nepal is 6.5%, beyond this threshold the economy might get into economic trouble (Nepal Rastra Bank, 2024). Similarly, an unemployment rate approximately 5% might be acceptable to ensure macroeconomic stability in any economy, other things remaining the same (Orji et al., 2015). As per the data from Nepal Rastra Bank and World development Indicators, the inflation rate in 2023 is 7.74% and unemployment rate is 10.63% in Nepal, stating that there is high rate of unemployment and fluctuation in inflation rate. 
The understanding of the relationship between inflation and unemployment is crucial for designing effective macroeconomic policies. For this purpose, the empirical analysis of the Phillips Curve Theory is necessary. This suggests that there is an inverse relationship between these two variables, where lower unemployment comes with higher inflation and vice versa (PHILLIP, 1958). However, several studies have been conducted in many developed economies and south asian developing economies to test the Phillips curve existence earlier. The findings, though are mixed based on the economy’s diversity, in some, there has shown inverse relationship between these variables in both short run and long run, in some, there has shown no relationship at all and in some, there has shown inverse relationship but only either in the short run or in the long run (Furuoka, 2007; Irushad, 2023; Kartika & Kurniasih, 2020; Muto & Shintani, 2017;Orji et al., 2015; Prabhakar, 2020; Selvaraj, 2020; Živković, 2023). The research on this particular topic is valuable for policymakers, particularly for the central banks and government to implement monetary and fiscal policies in controlling inflation and creating employment opportunities in the nation (Irushad, 2023). 
Despite the significance of this research topic, there is limited and no direct empirical research on the existence of the Phillips Curve hypothesis in the Nepalese context. While the existing studies in Nepal by Yadav, (2024) provides valuable insights into the macroeconomic dynamics of Nepal. The researcher focused on the effect of unemployment and inflation on economic growth and from the findings he acknowledged that there is an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment in the short run, which suggests the evidence for the presence of the Phillips curve in Nepal. However, the research is not rigorously testing the Phillips curve hypothesis, rather its primary objective is to observe the effect of these two variables on economic growth. Furthermore, the studies rely on Karl Pearson’s Correlation coefficient to establish the relationship which is of course useful but does not account for the causal relationship between the variables. The Phillips curve by its interpretation is not merely about correlation but it’s about tradeoffs, the causal impact. The study on the Phillips Curve is necessary because it addresses a fundamental gap in the macroeconomic literature specific to Nepalese context. While the prior research establishes correlations, it does not look for causality, key elements of the Phillips Curve debate. By explicitly modeling inflation as a function of unemployment, this research will provide the first dedicated test of the Phillips Curve hypothesis in Nepal. 
Similarly, other previous studies in Nepal have focused on “Effect of Money Supply on Inflation in Nepal (Joshi, 2021), Youth Employment Issues and their impact on the Economic Development of Nepal (Sharma & Poudel, 2023), Inflation with GDP, Unemployment and Remittances: An Outline of the Joint Effect on Nepalese Economy (Upadhyaya & Kharel, 2022) and so other papers on”, do not explicitly explore the existence of Phillips curve. The existing literature lacks a rigorous empirical examination of the existence of the Phillips Curve in Nepal. While the paper establishes correlations between inflation and unemployment, it does not test the Phillips Curve hypothesis explicitly or explore its short-run and long-run dynamics (Yadav, 2024; Upadhyaya & Kharel, 2022).
Understanding whether this economic trade-off between these two variables holds in Nepal is crucial for policymakers to design effective monetary and fiscal policies. If the Phillips Curve holds, it suggests a trade-off between inflation control and employment policies, if not then alternative explanations such as supply-side constraints, structural unemployment, or external dependencies may better explain Nepal’s macroeconomic dynamics. Given the limited research in this area, this study seeks to bridge the gap by analyzing whether the Phillips Curve hypothesis applies to Nepal or not which will ultimately contribute to a deeper understanding of how inflation and unemployment interact in a small, import-dependent economy. The findings could have significant implications for central bank policies, wage-setting mechanisms, and long-term economic planning in Nepal. To achieve the objective of the research, below given research questions are developed;
● Is there a tradeoff relationship between inflation and unemployment in the Nepalese Economy?
● Does the Phillips Curve hold and remain stable over time in the context of Nepal?
