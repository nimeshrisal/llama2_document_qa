Professor, KUSOM\n\n6th Feb, 2025\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nEconomic modelling is one of the very crucial steps in policy-making, allowing central banks and financial institutions to simulate various policy interventions before implementing them. One of the primary challenges in economic modelling is finding the optimal policy that minimizes loss and maximizes profitability of a firm, industry and a country. Having said that, in this paper the primary focus is to simulate an optimal monetary policy by reducing the output gap and maintaining the optimal inflation rate. In this process an AI model called reinforcement learning, particularly Q-learning, has been used to develop an optimized monetary policy framework. This approach has been enhanced by integrating Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based state transitions, which help guide learning in a structured and probabilistic manner.\n\nThe main objective is to use machine learning techniques to simulate and optimize economic decision-making, specifically in adjusting interest rates to minimize the output gap and stabilize inflation. The algorithm learns by interacting with an economic environment, where different monetary policy actions lead to distinct outcomes. Over multiple simulations, the agent discovers a policy that results in the most stable economic conditions.\n\nTo validate the effectiveness of the learned policy, multiple economic simulations has been conducted, tracking how states evolve over time. Further visualization of economic state transitions using network graphs has been done, allowing for an intuitive understanding of the trajectory an economy follows under different policy actions. \n\nData Preprocessing and Discretization\n\nThe dataset used in this study comprises key economic indicators such as:\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\n\nInflation Rate\n\nMoney Supply (M2)\n\nCurrency Circulation Ratio\n\nThese variables serve as inputs for the reinforcement learning model used, defining the state space in the MDP framework. However, working with continuous economic variables poses a challenge in reinforcement learning because it requires handling an infinitely large state space. To address this, quantile-based discretization has been applied to categorize economic variables into bins, reducing complexity while maintaining essential trends.\n\nAdditionally, to distinguish between long-term economic trends and short-term fluctuations, the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter has been applied, which decomposes GDP into:\n\nPotential GDP (long-term trend component)\n\nCyclical GDP (short-term fluctuations from the trend)\n\nUsing these components, we compute the output gap as follows:\n\nOutput\u00a0Gap = x100\n\nA large output gap suggests economic instability, prompting corrective monetary policy actions.\n\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP) Transition Matrix\n\nThe economic environment is modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the system transitions between different economic states based on policy actions.\n\nState Space Representation\n\nEach state in the MDP is defined as:\n\nState = (Inflation\u00a0Bin, Output\u00a0Gap\u00a0Bin, M2\u00a0Bin, Currency\u00a0Ratio\u00a0Bin)\n\nwhere:\n\nInflation Bin: Captures inflationary pressure.\n\nOutput Gap Bin: Measures economic performance relative to potential GDP.\n\nM2 Bin: Represents liquidity and potential inflationary impact.\n\nCurrency Ratio Bin: Provides insight into cash circulation and informal economic activity.\n\nBy binning continuous variables into discrete categories, we create a manageable state space suitable for reinforcement learning.\n\nAction Space Representation\n\nThe possible monetary policy actions include:\n\nDecrease Interest Rate (-1)\n\nMaintain Interest Rate (0)\n\nIncrease Interest Rate (1)\n\nEach action influences the state transitions, which are not entirely deterministic, making the system probabilistic in nature.\n\nMDP Transition Matrix Construction\n\nTo estimate how states evolve, state transition probabilities has been calculated from historical data:\n\nFor each state-action pair, how often each next state occurs has been counted.\n\nThese counts have been normalized to obtain transition probabilities, forming the MDP transition matrix.\n\nThese probabilities guide Q-learning, making state transitions more realistic and structured.\n\nQ-Learning with MDP State Transitions\n\nQ-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that helps the agent discover an optimal policy by interacting with the environment. The algorithm updates its knowledge using the Bellman equation:\n\nQ (s, a) = Q (s, a) + \u03b1 (R + \u03b3 max Q (s\u2032, a\u2032) \u2013 Q (s, a))\n\nWhere:\n\n\u03b1 = learning rate\n\n\u03b3 = discount factor\n\nR = reward function\n\ns\u2032 = next state\n\na\u2032 = next action\n\nIncorporating MDP state transitions improves Q-learning by ensuring that next-state selections align with real-world transition probabilities, making the learning process more stable and efficient.\n\nResults\n\nThe Q-learning optimized monetary policy demonstrates a data-driven strategy for interest rate adjustments based on the state of the economy. The learned policy suggests expansionary measures (decreasing interest rates) in recessionary conditions, contractionary measures (increasing rates) in inflationary environments, and neutral stances where the economy is stable. The results indicate that monetary policy actions must be adaptive, responding dynamically to fluctuations in inflation, output gap, liquidity, and cash circulation patterns.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5647, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d84d59d0-d7f0-4d71-8ae9-8cc939ada282": {"__data__": {"id_": "d84d59d0-d7f0-4d71-8ae9-8cc939ada282", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "23916_nimesh.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Home\\Desktop\\llama-qa\\backend\\data\\uploads\\23916_nimesh.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 276838, "creation_date": "2025-05-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-06"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "efadb694-5ba6-407f-b434-c092d34e3523", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "23916_nimesh.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Home\\Desktop\\llama-qa\\backend\\data\\uploads\\23916_nimesh.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 276838, "creation_date": "2025-05-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-06"}, "hash": "ff60e49647dbb62b4d314514ae29cc487c7648a745b61d1ec17aede6bcd173d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "da650e72-f4c3-4876-bfbb-432062830d5d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "23916_nimesh.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Home\\Desktop\\llama-qa\\backend\\data\\uploads\\23916_nimesh.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 276838, "creation_date": "2025-05-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-06"}, "hash": "29421739c19596b08bc371d552d7a7e3e9ac05bb56e19669026380770d831018", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "88ef71be-cc5f-4e06-a0fa-639375bdff95", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf912ab18d15308e4f643e8167940394aae4a78c7592fa71dd37e7e6dee1b0f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Fig: Q-learning optimizes policies\n\nThe State value defines the situation of the state variable:\n\nInflation Bin (Index: 0): Represents inflation levels, where 0 = very low (deflation risk) and 4 = very high (inflationary pressure requiring rate hikes).\n\nOutput Gap Bin (Index: 1): Measures economic performance; 0 = recession (below potential GDP) and 4 = overheating economy (above potential GDP, requiring tightening).\n\nM2 Bin \u2013 Money Supply (Index: 2): Captures liquidity; 0 = credit shortage, slow growth and 4 = excessive liquidity, risk of inflationary overheating.\n\nCurrency Ratio Bin (Index: 3): Tracks cash circulation; 0 = highly formal economy and 4 = cash-dominant, high informal sector activity (weak policy transmission).\n\nFrom the simulation results, several economic trends emerge. The model frequently suggests lowering interest rates when the output gap is negative and money supply is low, indicating an economy operating below its potential. Conversely, it recommends rate hikes in cases of excessive liquidity or high inflation, demonstrating alignment with traditional central banking strategies. The states that require policy intervention tend to cluster around extremes\u2014either high inflation with liquidity excesses or low inflation with stagnation. These findings reinforce the importance of balancing economic growth and inflation control through monetary policy precision.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFig: Economic Simulations\n\nEconomic Interpretation of the Policies Formulated\n\nExpansionary Policy (Decreasing Interest Rates)\n\nOne of the most significant findings is that the model frequently suggests lowering interest rates in states where the output gap is negative, inflation is moderate or low, and money supply is constrained. For instance, in state (2,0,0,2), the policy suggests a rate cut, indicating that the economy is experiencing low inflation, weak output, and restricted credit availability. This aligns with Keynesian economic principles, where lower interest rates boost demand, investment, and employment.\n\nHowever, the model also carefully avoids aggressive rate cuts in cases where liquidity is already high. In state (3,1,0,1), for example, a rate decrease is recommended, but only when the output gap is sufficiently negative. This highlights the trade-off between stimulating growth and preventing excessive money supply, ensuring that inflation remains under control.\n\nContractionary Policy (Increasing Interest Rates)\n\nIn states where inflation is high, liquidity is excessive, or the economy is overheating, the model suggests raising interest rates to prevent runaway inflation and asset bubbles. For instance, in state (4,0,1,1), where inflation is at its peak and the money supply is ample, the policy recommends a rate hike to slow down inflationary pressures. This follows the monetarist approach, where central banks use interest rate adjustments to control inflation by limiting credit expansion.\n\nAnother example is state (3,2,4,2), where inflation remains high, and the economy shows positive output growth. Here, the model correctly suggests an interest rate hike, preventing an overheated economy from spiralling into an inflationary bubble. This is aligned with the Taylor Rule, which suggests that interest rates should increase when inflation exceeds its target or when output exceeds potential GDP.\n\nNeutral Policy (Maintaining Interest Rates)\n\nIn several states, the model determines that no interest rate adjustments are necessary, implying that the economy is already in equilibrium. In states like (0,0,0,2) and (3,3,2,4), where inflation is low, the output gap is near zero, and liquidity conditions are balanced, the policy suggests maintaining interest rates.\n\nThis supports the idea that monetary policy should not always be interventionist. Frequent and aggressive rate changes can lead to market instability and policy credibility issues. The model\u2019s ability to recognize when to take a hands-off approach demonstrates its robustness in balancing economic stability and policy intervention.\n\nConclusion and Future Works\n\nThe Q-learning optimized monetary policy provides a robust framework for interest rate decisions based on macroeconomic conditions. The results align well with real-world central banking principles, including:\n\nLowering rates during recessions to stimulate demand.\n\nRaising rates in overheating economies to control inflation.\n\nMaintaining rates in stable conditions to prevent unnecessary intervention.\n\nThe model's ability to analyse inflation, output gaps, money supply, and currency circulation simultaneously highlights the complexity of monetary policy decisions. Unlike rule-based frameworks like the Taylor Rule, which use fixed formulas, this approach adapts dynamically to changing economic conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the model sheds light on the limitations of conventional monetary tools in high-cash economies, emphasizing the need for complementary fiscal policies and financial inclusion strategies.\n\nGoing forward, enhancing this model with real-time economic data and incorporating global macroeconomic shocks could improve policy responsiveness and accuracy. This AI-driven approach serves as a valuable decision-support system for central banks and policymakers, ensuring monetary policies remain data-driven, responsive, and stability-focused.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5655, "end_char_idx": 10999, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88ef71be-cc5f-4e06-a0fa-639375bdff95": {"__data__": {"id_": "88ef71be-cc5f-4e06-a0fa-639375bdff95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "23916_nimesh.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Home\\Desktop\\llama-qa\\backend\\data\\uploads\\23916_nimesh.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 276838, "creation_date": "2025-05-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-06"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "efadb694-5ba6-407f-b434-c092d34e3523", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "23916_nimesh.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Home\\Desktop\\llama-qa\\backend\\data\\uploads\\23916_nimesh.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 276838, "creation_date": "2025-05-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-06"}, "hash": "ff60e49647dbb62b4d314514ae29cc487c7648a745b61d1ec17aede6bcd173d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d84d59d0-d7f0-4d71-8ae9-8cc939ada282", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "23916_nimesh.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Home\\Desktop\\llama-qa\\backend\\data\\uploads\\23916_nimesh.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 276838, "creation_date": "2025-05-06", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-06"}, "hash": "3715afee724a4d0c51626620f413f79f106fba144670bb41c7bef8e1a5be4a54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "References\n\nTaylor, J.
